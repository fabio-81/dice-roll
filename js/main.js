//***** Right now you are: *******

// - Building the html and css to look as if we rolled 3
// - Using the browser's developer tools to modify the document to look as if you rolled a 5
// - Write out the "micro" steps you took, like this....

//find the .face image

//Change the value of the src attribute of the .face image

//locate the .result output

//Change the value of the content within to reflect the new roll

//look for the .roll button

//Listen for the .roll button to be clicked
